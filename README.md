# Common issues and possible solutions
- Dimensions/font size/location of elements are strange
  - This is often due to zooming/resizing of the browser. Try resetting the browser zoom to 100%, usually that should be enough
- Load error/white page: just refresh page
  - Likely due to loading files with the incorrect panel
- Region not being colored:
  - Usually due to color picker/eraser being on, so check if they are
