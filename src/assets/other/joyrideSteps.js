                <p>***NEW FEATURES*** September, 2022</p>
                <p>Condensed timeline view (on left of page): Can be used to navigate the timeline by clocking on entries and add new events, albeit cannot edit events/dates here.</p>
                <p>Play timeline toolbar (on the left of the page): Currently offers 1x to 16x speeds, where 1x corresponds to ~2s per time point</p>
                <hr/>
                <p>FAQs:</p>
                <p>Changing color of regions of same color: toggle "Same" button, then color as usual</p>
                <p>Removing borders: set region border width to 0 in theme panel on the right</p>
                <p>Adding markers with tooltips: use marker box on side panel; added markers can be dragged and clicked to reveal/edit tooltip</p>
                <p>Custom geoJSON saves don't load: load them using CustomGeoJSON panel (saves too), not the load button</p>
